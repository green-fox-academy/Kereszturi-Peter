1) Introduce yourself briefly

2) Include github names

3) Find the balance to show code, don't show too much, tell how you 
understood the project

4) Be yourself, don't be nervous

5) Put things about yourself between code, "show who you are"

6) Start earlier maybe

7) White background is readable!!!
